Filter-repo:

Removing a directory
git filter-repo --path node_modules/electron/dist/ --invert-paths


Do this for the whole dir and then recommit with PNGs?
Wait, already have a file in LFS, filter repo may have an issue there.

Just purge list of files.
git filter-repo --invert-paths --paths-from-file ../DELETED_FILENAMES.txt
